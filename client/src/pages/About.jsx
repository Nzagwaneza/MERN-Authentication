      <p className=" mb-4 text-slate-800">
        I’m a passionate developer with a keen interest in creating dynamic and
        efficient web applications. My journey in programming began with a
        curiosity for how websites work, which quickly evolved into a deep dive
        into full-stack development. I specialize in using the MERN stack
        (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) to build scalable, secure, and
        user-friendly applications.
      </p>
      <p className=" mb-4 text-slate-800">
        With a solid understanding of both frontend and backend technologies, I
        strive to create seamless experiences for users while maintaining
        strong, secure infrastructures. In addition to my technical skills, I am
        a continuous learner, always excited to embrace new technologies and
        challenges. Whether it’s developing an authentication system, like this
        app, or working on data-driven solutions, I am committed to delivering
        high-quality code and innovative solutions.
